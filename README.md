# Improving-User-Experience-for-Color-Blind

Almost all of the web applications in the
current technological world are biased to the
conventional users, at the same time
disabled people like color blind people are
facing difficulties recognizing various
shades, tones and tints of the colors in the
websites due to their decreased ability in
differentiating between colors. In this paper,
we would like to present different types of
color blindness, problems faced by them
while using web applications.

## Proposed Solution

The lack of ability to identify and
differentiate between multiple colors is the
major perplexity a user experiences while
using a web application. Moreover, they
expect a better user interface which enables
them to use the applications with ease.
Our aim is to present plugins for web
applicationsin which we try to establish a
color combination that is easily
distinguishable to people of all color vision
deficiencies.Each kind of user can have their
own user experience with the websites by
configuring according to their preferences.
People who are unaware of their color
blindness characteristics, can get an idea
about their vision deficiency type by
undertaking a brief test which pops out the
moment a user installs the plugin. We ask
them a few series of questions about some
pictures and to select an answer from the list
which best describes their view on the
picture.
This extension aids colorblind people while
browsing, by processing the web pages so
that they can recognize data and have a
better visualization of the information. 
We make sure that the most important
content in any website is not left
unnoticeable due to the color used; that is, it
should be color blind safe. Any text that
takes longer time to read is supposed to be
in high contrast.

## Data Analysis

There are roughly 8% of all men and 0.5%
of all women suffering from color blindness.
Also, according to the research conducted
by international journal of innovative
research and development on 225
candidates, 4 individuals were suspected of
color vision defect. Among them 2.2% of
male and 1.1% of female were found to be
color blind.
The ratio of visitors viewing the web with
only 256 colors or a 640x480 pixel screen
are about 5% of the total web users
worldwide which is due to color blindness.
This may seem a very less number but over
108 million web users are color blind. So,
there is a need for making websites color
blind friendly.
Most color-blind people, that is, over 99
percent of them have trouble distinguishing
between red and green.
